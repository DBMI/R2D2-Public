## COVID-19 Severity

### Question
“Among adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, what was the association between a combined severity endpoint (in-hospital mortality, invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or ICU transfer) and the following exposures: 
demographic variables (age, gender, race, ethnicity), body mass index, comorbidities (history of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure with reduced/preserved ejection fraction, asthma, COPD, cancer [breast/prostate/lung/colorectal/blood cell/melanoma/bladder/kidney/endometrium/pancreas], HIV, transplant [kidney/liver/lung/heart], chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease), blood type A vs. non-A, and selected laboratory values (D-dimer, troponin I, troponin T, C-reactive protein, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophils/leukocytes ratio, ferritin, LDH, direct bilirubin, albumin, BUN, creatinine)?”

## Question Details
### Question (compact)
Among adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, what patient factors are
associated with COVID-19 severity (combined endpoint of mortality, need for ventilation,
or ICU transfer)?

### Background/rationale/objectives
As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to spread in the U.S. and other parts of the world, it is increasingly clear that we need to develop disease severity scores to aid in both patient care and clinical research. Disease severity scores are important for several reasons. First, and most importantly, disease severity scores help us improve and target our patient care by triaging patients more appropriately and making decisions on therapies. Secondly, disease severity might be useful to more accurately plan what resources will be used for clinical care. Finally, a score would be incredibly useful for enrolling and risk stratifying patients in COVID-19 research and clinical trials. Several studies have identified patient factors such as laboratory values, but they have not been validated in a multi-center, real-world data set.

### Setting/participants
Adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients

### Variables – outcome
Combined severity endpoint of
  * in-hospital mortality,
  * invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or
  * ICU transfer

### Variables – exposures
  * demographic variables (age, gender, race, ethnicity)
  * body mass index
  * comorbidities (
      * history of arterial hypertension,
      * diabetes mellitus, 
      * coronary artery disease, 
      * chronic heart failure with reduced/preserved ejection fraction, 
      * asthma, 
      * COPD,

      * HIV, 
      * transplant [kidney/liver/lung/heart], 
      * chronic kidney disease, 
      * chronic liver disease
      )
  * blood type (A, B, AB, O)
  * selected laboratory values (
      * D-dimer, 
      * troponin I, 
      * troponin T, 
      * C-reactive protein, 
      * absolute lymphocyte count, 
      * neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, 
      * ferritin, 
      * LDH, 
      * direct bilirubin, 
      * albumin, 
      * BUN, 
      * creatinine)
