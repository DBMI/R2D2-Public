## Venous Thromboembolism & Pulmonary Embolism

### Question
- What are the age, race, ethnicity and gender characteristics associated with <br>
**any venous thromboembolism disease including pulmonary embolism** in patients who are COVID-19+?  
- What are the age, race, ethnicity and gender characteristics associated with <br>
**pulmonary embolism-specific diagnoses** in patients who are COVID-19+? 

### Request
| Requestor name | Requestor Institution| Request date | Requestor email        |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|------------------------|
|        |     UC Davis       |    09/25/2020          |    |


### Concept Set
The query is targetting a set of SNOMED codes. The SQL will look for any other codes that 'Maps To' these SNOMEDs via the concept_relationship table.  This will enable the SQL to pick up those ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes that are mapped to the SNOMED codes.
