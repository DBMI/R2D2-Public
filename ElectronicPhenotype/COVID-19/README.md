### Canonical SQL/Stored Procedures:
A set of hospitalization encounters for adult COVID-19 patients will be identified by executing the SQL/stored procedure function:
* [template_sp_identify_hospitalization_encounters.sql](https://github.com/DBMI/R2D2-Public/blob/master/Question_0000/sql/template_sp_identify_hospitalization_encounters.sql)
<br> which executes (line 87) the stored procedure [template_fn_identify_patients.sql](https://github.com/DBMI/R2D2-Public/blob/master/Question_0000/sql/template_fn_identify_patients.sql)
* Example: [Question_0008](https://github.com/DBMI/R2D2-Public/tree/master/Question_0008) see [template_query.sql](https://github.com/DBMI/R2D2-Public/blob/master/Question_0008/sql/template_query.sql) (line 82)
