To the [results] directory, please upload .csv file of 42 rows and 7 columns in the following format with a header (one .csv file per institution named as SiteXX_results.csv)
  * Column 1: Site number in the format of (SiteXX)
  * Column 2: Variable name with permissible values of {AgeRange, Ethnicity, Gender, Race}.

  * Column 4: Outcome with permissible values of {transferred_to_ICU, not_transferred_to_ICU}

  * Column 6: Query version
  * Column 7: Query execution date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

Please include all permissible values defined in [the template result] even when the patient count is zero (e.g. using left join). The same number of rows is expected in every result file. This would expedite the processes of data QC and aggregation across institutions.
